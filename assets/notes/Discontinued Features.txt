1. Option setting how many timers to add (eg: add 5 new timers upon clicking the add button).

2. Header and timer settings to be fixed at top of browser.

3. Modal addition that asks "Overwrite the existing profile? Y/N".

4. Timer automatically resets when it reaches 0.

5. Ability to change the alarm track of a timer after creation.

6. Change the cursor to "grabbing" when actively grabbing an element. (This isn't really a discontinued feature, but seems more of a limitation since the cursor on dragover seems like it can't be changed)
