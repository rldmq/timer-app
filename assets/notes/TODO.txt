Issues:
-Issue with merging timers due to positions being combined (eg: there will be two timers with a position of 1)
-there is an issue with adding a red box around the save and load modals.  it seems like because of the innerHTML +=, it is refreshing the page.  If you log the input element and try to select it, it says that it does not exist
- (-,+,.,e) keys seem to work for the number input (low priority)
-modal inputs are being reset when profiles are not found
-modal should decativate everything on the page

Features to consider:
-password protect profiles
-visual for drag and drop (area to grab and area to drop to)
-edit timer settings (hh mm ss)
-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

Refactor:
-create functions for eventlisteners with WET code (eg: the window event listeners)
-review theme functions (load and change are basically the same thing)
