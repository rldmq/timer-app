-edit timer settings 

-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

-add alarm sound option

-add function for display calculation (it is very repetitive)

-add function for the innerhtml of timers (used by newtimerbtn and loadtimers)

-change timer settings grid for desktop view

-issue with name being broken when there are spaces

-load and save profile notification, set so that box does not wiggle

-load and save profile modal styles

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers

-start > pause > loop (starts the timer but shouldnt)

-there is another issue with starting and pausing with a loop option (basically loop is enabled but the timer stops at the end anyway)
