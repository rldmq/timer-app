-start all
-stop all
-pause all

-firebase

-edit timer settings 

-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

-add alarm sound option

-add function for display calculation (it is very repetitive)

-add function for the innerhtml of timers (used by newtimerbtn and loadtimers)

-change timer settings grid for desktop view

-issue with name being broken when there are spaces

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers

-start > pause > loop (starts the timer but shouldnt)

-there is another issue with starting and pausing with a loop option (basically loop is enabled but the timer stops at the end anyway)

did today:
// finish loading
    // add in cancel
//finish saving
    // add in cancel
    // add in replace

Ideas:
save layout - name
    -the existing layout will be overridden (y/n)
    -overwrite, add to, cancel (button options)
