-start all
-stop all
-pause all

-store timers in local storage
    -this will eventually move to firebase

-looping

-add labels to timer

-edit timer label

-edit timer settings

-always center app

-media query for smaller screens (mobile in particular)
    -the timer settings and the actual timers themselves go beyond 100% width

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers

Refactor:
instead of queryselectorall[0], simply change to query selector

-start > pause > loop (starts the timer but shouldnt)

-there is another issue with starting and pausing with a loop option (basically loop is enabled but the timer stops at the end anyway)

-issue with smaller screens (see to do above)
