-start all
-reset all
-pause all
-delete all

-edit timer settings 

-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

-add alarm sound option

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers (setInterval is still running)

a combination of starting pausing and looping starts the timer when it shouldn't (when loop is toggled)

Refactor:
--

did today:
-fixed profile button resizing (still issue with >1100 width)
-fixed hovering color issue for timers
-removed local storage and integrated firebase
-added delete profile functionality
-added loop to timerobj so that loop state is saved


// there is an issue with adding a red box around the save and load modals.  it seems like because of the innerHTML +=, it is refreshing the page.  If you log the input element and try to select it, it says that it does not exist
// add: inserting new timer resets other timers
// modal should decativate everything on the page
// fix modal inputs being reset when profile not found
// visual queue for when timer reaches 0
// -,+,.,e keys seem to work for the number input (low priority)

Tests:
-save while timers are running
