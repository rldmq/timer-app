-start all
-stop all
-pause all

-store timers in local storage
    -this will eventually move to firebase

-looping

-edit timer label (ideally click on text and edit) or have an edit button (pencil)

-edit timer settings 

-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

-when the timer settings is 0, do not reset the name

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers

Refactor:
instead of queryselectorall[0], simply change to query selector

-start > pause > loop (starts the timer but shouldnt)

-there is another issue with starting and pausing with a loop option (basically loop is enabled but the timer stops at the end anyway)
