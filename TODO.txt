-start all
-stop all
-pause all

-clicking on pause again should start the timer again
    -alternatively, once a timer is paused, the pause button should become disabled, and user should press start again to continue

-store timers in local storage
    -this will eventually move to firebase

Issues:
-ID of the timers (currently going by count)
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers
