-edit timer settings 

-unsplash for backgrounds (very light)

-different alarm sounds

Issues:
-adding a new timer while existing timers are running pauses the existing timers (setInterval is still running) just add a clear interval for intervalobj on the handle start?

Refactor:
--

did today:
-drag and drop
-bug fix on looping persistence

// password protect profiles
// dark mode
// sound
// issue with merge since positions are not updated and end up overlapping

// there is an issue with adding a red box around the save and load modals.  it seems like because of the innerHTML +=, it is refreshing the page.  If you log the input element and try to select it, it says that it does not exist
// add: inserting new timer resets other timers
// modal should decativate everything on the page
// fix modal inputs being reset when profile not found
// visual queue for when timer reaches 0
// -,+,.,e keys seem to work for the number input (low priority)

// create draggable elements
//create droppable elements

// add draggable="true" to html element (in the js for us)
//  create dragstart function (Refer to docs)
